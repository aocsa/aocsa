## Database and GPU Software Engineer | Specialist in Data Analytics 

### About

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and bring over 10 years of experience in software engineering, with a focus on performance optimization and GPU-accelerated computing. I have a proven track record of driving improvements in database optimization, numerical computing, and deep learning, contributing to major open-source projects like PyTorch, Apache Arrow, NVIDIA RapidsAI, and more.

### Core Expertise

- Advanced query optimization and indexing strategies, consistently delivering large improvements in query engines throughput and responsiveness
- GPU acceleration, leveraging CUDA and libraries like PyTorch and CuDF to achieve 10x-50x speedups in data-intensive workloads
- Pioneer in PyTorch sparse tensor support, enabling efficient processing of large-scale, sparse datasets
- Algorithm design, creating novel solutions for complex data processing challenges in big data environments

### Open-Source Contributions 

- [Pytorch](http://github.com/pytorch) - Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration
- [Apache Arrow](http://github.com/apache/arrow) - A development platform for in-memory analytics. 
- [CuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) -  GPU DataFrame Library
- [Blazingsql](https://github.com/blazingdb/blazingsql) - BlazingSQL is a lightweight, GPU accelerated, SQL engine for Python. Built on RAPIDS cuDF.

I have a deep passion for data structures and algorithms. What fascinates me most is how they evolve and adapt as they scaleâ€”like constructing a complex bridge with Lego blocks, where each optimization introduces new strengths and challenges.
