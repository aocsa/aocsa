### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸ”­ With over a decade of seasoned experience in both the software industry and academia, I bring a deep understanding of data analytics, GPU programming, and scientific computing. My expertise encompasses database and query optimization, multimedia databases, information retrieval, and algorithm implementation, with a special focus on GPU programming using CUDA and sparse array theory, particularly with PyTorch sparse tensor support.

My current interests in Data Analytics and Scientific Computing include:

- Engine databases and query optimization
- GPU programming with CUDA 
- Theory of Sparse Arrays, in particular, PyTorch sparse tensors support

I have contributed to a number of open source projects:

- [Apache Arrow](http://github.com/apache/arrow) - A development platform for in-memory analytics. 
- [Pytorch](http://github.com/pytorch) - Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration
- [CuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) -  GPU DataFrame Library
- [Blazingsql](https://github.com/blazingdb/blazingsql) - BlazingSQL is a lightweight, GPU accelerated, SQL engine for Python. Built on RAPIDS cuDF.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: I am focused on GPU programming, GPU databases, GPU Data Analytics, Sparse Tensors and High-Performance Computing for distributed GPU systems. As a professional, I have more than 10+ years of experience in the software industry and in the academy as a professor at university level. Lot of experience with C/C++, Python, Java software development in UNIX/MAC environments.
