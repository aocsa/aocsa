## 🚀 Database and GPU Software Engineer

### 👋 About Me

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and bring over 10 years of experience in software engineering, specializing in performance optimization and GPU-accelerated computing. I have a proven track record of driving significant improvements in query engine optimization, numerical computing, and deep learning, contributing to leading open-source projects such as PyTorch, Apache Arrow, NVIDIA RapidsAI, and more.

I’m currently a Staff Software Engineer at VoltronData, working with the Theseus team to develop a cutting-edge GPU Query Engine designed to handle petabyte-scale data. My primary focus is on optimizing complex data operations to increase speed and efficiency. By streamlining data workflows and boosting performance, I aim to deliver impactful solutions that drive better decision-making and scalability for enterprises working with large datasets.

### 🛠 Core Expertise

- ⚡ Advanced query optimization and indexing strategies, consistently delivering large improvements in query engine throughput and responsiveness.
- 🎯 GPU acceleration, leveraging CUDA and libraries like PyTorch and CuDF to achieve 10x-50x speedups in data-intensive workloads.
- 🔧 Pioneer in PyTorch sparse tensor support, enabling efficient processing of large-scale, sparse datasets.
- 🧠 Algorithm design, creating innovative solutions for complex data processing challenges in big data environments.

### 🌍 Open-Source Contributions 

- [PyTorch](http://github.com/pytorch) - Tensors and dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration.
- [Apache Arrow](http://github.com/apache/arrow) - A development platform for in-memory analytics.
- [CuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) - GPU DataFrame library.
- [BlazingSQL](https://github.com/blazingdb/blazingsql) - A lightweight, GPU-accelerated SQL engine for Python, built on RAPIDS cuDF.

I have a deep passion for data structures and algorithms. What fascinates me most is how they evolve and adapt as they scale—like building a complex bridge with Lego blocks, where each optimization introduces new strengths and challenges.
