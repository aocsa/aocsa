### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at XYZ

My current interests in Data Analytics and Scientific Computing include:

- Databases and query optimization
- Multimedia databases and information retrieval
- Algorithms and Implementations
- GPU programming with CUDA 
- Theory of Sparse Arrays, in particular, PyTorch sparse tensors support

I have contributed to a number of open source projects:

- Pytorch - Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration
- CuDF -  GPU DataFrame Library
- Blazingsql - BlazingSQL is a lightweight, GPU accelerated, SQL engine for Python. Built on RAPIDS cuDF.

During the last years, I was focused on GPU programming, GPU databases, GPU Data Analytics, Sparse Tensors and High-Performance Computing for distributed GPU systems. As a professional, I have more than 10+ years of experience in the software industry and in the academy as a professor at university level. Lot of experience with C/C++, Python, Java software development in UNIX/MAC environments. Whether it's a large system requiring robust conceptualization or AI/ML workload script, I'll write it.
